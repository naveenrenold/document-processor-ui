2/6/25
1.  I need to add view form / complete form
2. In future search form also
3. So view form is simple just real from url if formId exists then readonly
4.send api call to db and it should return both data and files
5. files if removed and readded should be reflected in db

power : 75
complete feature :100
work all day :50
extras : 25


things to do :
read url
check access
2 modes readonly and not readonly

lets finish readonly first

check access and display if user has access and form exits
you have to download attachments

queryparams proper way to add?

complete:
update formId from api response
use formid to display check box -> otp -> complete


edit:
tricky
add edit button

edit attchment : dialog for deleting old attachment

attachment:
process api in parallel - done
new attachment api - done
should download files and send -done
is byte[] enough - done
time to do it , test with insomnia -done

api is working make the other changes too -??? done

now for edit and save changes

edit button added!
wait edit save must save the same form lol

before doing edit form think for some time

before i proceed with update should i think of activity -> no cause its not fun  and in my way!
atleast one attachment must be present

edit looks good but needs some testing

what about complete

edit for is bad. delete can be different

edit needs the following :
1. in request from ui pass the attachmentIds alone - done
2. in api delete those ids and fetch name. with these name delete them  -done
3. from ui when submit button is clicked it should be similar - done
4. in edit mode flow will show dialog when attachment is deleted and on ok it will be saved
5. during api calls these attschment details is sent

remmeber attachments are not updated just added and removed\

add the dialogs
repeating attachment uploads

delete attachmentss

delete dialog - done

form mode and submit = 

canedit
readonly
submitchecked
edited?


create -> view -> canedit(view with access) <-> edit
view ->submit

create - default 
view - if formId valid
canedit -> formid valid and access
edit -> click on edit

submit -> click on submit only from view
view ->submit not possible will become canedit
problem canedit and view are same

checkbox disappear after edit button is clicked or edit happened
then need state for edit happened separate value

modes and dialog done

cancel edits -done
